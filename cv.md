### Summary

I had several classes of Mobile Application Development when I was a student. After graduation, I got into a company that worked with *ruby*. It is already more than two years using ruby as main language in my life, but I still remember the joy of development of mobile applications. Since then I had some attempts to dive more into mob dev, but it didn't seem to work. I really like the process of realizing that you can actually create something real by coding. Despite my eternal love to *ruby*, I think that mobile application development has more to do with creativity which I highly appreciate. That is why I want to learn mobile dev, specifically based on iOS, because I am a huge fan of Apple products :)

### Skills

I had some *C++, C, Java, PHP* classes as a student, but that was a long time ago. I had an experience to work with Javascript and even took "getting started" courses for *VueJS*. And also I had a chance to create little demo apps based on *iOS (Swift)* and *Android (Java)*. But the main language that I use everyday is *Ruby* and with the Rails framework and RSpec of course :) Git is my friend with whom I interact every day, but there are still some commands that I'm not familiar with.

### Code examples

Lately I'm not working on any side projects except my job processes, but it is possible to check my recent little demos [here](https://github.com/gulnazkassym)

### Education

I am a bachelor of engineering and technology. I took several getting started video courses on ruby, ruby on rails, frontend courses on "Codeacademy", JS frameworks and even "Data analysis with python" course in Yandex.Praktikum.

### English

My education at university was partly in English, also I had an experience of student exchange program for three months in the USA. I use english every day, I have read tons of technical articles, books and watched bunch TV shows in English, but there is a still room to grow, so I have my weekly english classes these days too.
